			How's business? Boomin. I'm up to something. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. Surround yourself with angels. The key is to enjoy life, because they don't want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don't want you to jetski, they don't want you to smile. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion!
